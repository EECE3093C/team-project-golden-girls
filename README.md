# Obscene Odds

We will be making a sports betting application. **There will be dark mode**. Maybe this whole thing will be dark mode!

Our platform is obscenely helpful.

## Vision

Obscene odds is a dashboard that provides team and player statistics and odds to aid in sports betting. It’s designed for people who are new to betting or those who want to perform their own statistical analyses on players and teams. It solves the problem of information being spread out all over the internet by centralizing it in one place. Since it doesn’t involve human analysts, it also solves the problem of possible bias. It allows less advanced sports betters (that aren’t watching every game) the ability to quickly evaluate a bet based on its odds and how teams or players are currently performing.

### Alternatives and Competitors

Sites like ESPN/NBA official websites provide the ability to view statistics of players and teams for a couple games in the past, but fail to format it in a way that is comprehensive to the average sports better. There are also paid services that provide professional analysis of certain bets and stats to back up the analysis but aren’t services an average bettor would want to pay for. 

### What makes our product different

Most bets are made with a severe lack of insight into the quality of the bet based on previous statistics. The reasoning can often be not knowing where to get the data. Centralizing the data and making it easy for users to filter and sift through the data while also having access to live odds allows users to make, while not perfect bets, much better informed ones.
### Audience (for whom)

This is for people who like to sports bet that want all the information on the screen from different sports betting websites

Basic Users: Users that would simply want to see basic info such as odds and records of teams etc.
Advanced Users: Users that would 

### Objectives/Scope

Our high level objectives are to create a front end with
- A landing page
- An intuitive display for showing relevant stats from recent games
- A display for the odds of different betting sites

and a back end that
- Retrieves statistical data using apis
- Parses that statistical data and serves it to the frontend

Originally, we will design the website to work with NBA statistics and bets, and then, time permitting, we will expand it to include other major sports leagues.

## Architecture

We will be making a web-based app with a frontend and a backend. The frontend will interact with the backend through API calls. We will provide an option to export data/filters/stats to the user’s local computer. We will use React.js for the frontend and Node.js for the backend.


## Challenges and Risks

Some challenges we may run into:
- Inexperience with certain project management techniques
- Inexperience with nodejs and React
- Project complexity
- Catering to both an advanced and beginner audience
- Integrating the api information into
- Coordinating the tasks so that all members can meaningfully contribute simultaneously
- The single most serious challenge we expect to face is complexity in the project formed by interfacing the frontend and backend. We will mitigate this risk by staying on track and adding test cases and documentation. In particular, we will ensure our backend's interface is very thoroughly documented.
